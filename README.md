# ICNS 2018: Visualizing Partible Inheritance among Early Modern Merchants

This repository contains data, code, and plots used for my presentation on visualizing the inheritance of the Della Faille family from 1582 until 1594.

The presentation was given at the International Conference of Netherlandic Studies on June 2nd, 2018 in Bloomington, Indiana.

The plots serve as an example of types of visualization it is possible to make from an account book that uses double-entry bookkeeping. The analysis of the account book of the estate of Jan della Faille de Oude is done with my own [debkeepr package](https://github.com/jessesadler/debkeepr), which simplifies the analysis of accounting done the money of account of pounds, shillings, and pence.
